# Iliad

> There is no place where one really feels at home anymore.   
> 
> So, the thing that one longs to get back to, before anything else,  
>  
> is whatever place there may be where one could feel at home,   
> 
> and that is because it is in that place - and in that place alone -   
>   
> 
> where one would really like to feel at home.   
> 
> That place is the world of the **Greeks**.

### English Translations and Audiobooks

#### Translated by Ian Johnson {#Johnson-Iliad}

<p style="text-align:center"> <img src="images/Johnson-Iliad.jpg" width="225" height="325" alt="Cover image" /> </p>

In [Ian Johnson][1], *free*

The audio version by [Anton Lesser][2] is in [Naxos Audiobooks][3].

This version is not as popular as the big three in Section \@ref(Fagles-Iliad). I put it on top because this is the most accessible *Iliad* I have even read and it's FREE. Another bonus is the high quality unabridged audiobook.

#### Translated by Samuel Butler, Revised by Gregory Nagy et al. {#Nagy-Iliad}

In [Center For Hellenic Studies](http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5286), *free*

The only prose translation in this list. Used in a MOOC course of \@ref(Nagy-H24H-Iliad).

One of the revisers [Gregory Nagy](http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/1234) said this revised translation aims to be as honest as possible to the original Greek text. 

#### Translated by [Robert Fagles](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Robert_Fagles) {#Fagles-Iliad}

<p style="text-align:center"> <img src="images/Fagles-Iliad.jpg" width="225" height="325" alt="Cover image" />  </p>

In [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140275363/). This is arguably the best translation in the market considering the [tradeoff of rigorousness and readability](https://oldbooksblog.wordpress.com/2010/10/18/best-translation-iliad/). It's also the only print version I hold.

The [corresponding audiobook](http://www.audible.com/pd/Classics/The-Iliad-Audiobook/B002V5D8LU/) is abridged, unfortunately. This is the only drawback I think of using this version (not the version itself).

Traditionally the other two strong competitive translations are [Richmond Lattimore](https://www.amazon.com/Iliad-Homer/dp/0226470490/) and [Robert Fitzgerald](https://www.amazon.com/Iliad-Homer/dp/0374529051/). These two versions both have nice unabridged audiobooks:

<img src="images/Fitzgerald-Iliad.jpg" width="225" height="325" alt="Cover image" />   </p>  


#### Translated by [Caroline Alexander](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Caroline_Alexander_(author)) {#Caroline-Iliad}

<p style="text-align:center"> <img src="images/Caroline-Iliad.jpg" width="225" height="325" alt="Cover image" />  </p>

In [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Iliad-New-Translation-Caroline-Alexander/dp/0062046284/). 

There are dozens of modern translations of *Iliad* and the reason I single this new translation out is solely because, this is the very first female translation of Homer around the world! Currently I only read a fraction of her translation from one of her other books, [*The War That Killed Achilles*](https://www.amazon.com/War-That-Killed-Achilles-Homers/dp/0143118269/).
