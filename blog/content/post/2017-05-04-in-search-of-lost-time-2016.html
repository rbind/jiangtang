<p>2016 was gone, and I didn’t even leave one single blog post. An obvious inference should be, 2016 doesn’t exist…</p>
<p>2016 was a year of struggle for me as a SAS programmer. I earn my bread mostly using SAS, but is a SAS programmer like me cool? It’s not a silly question. Lots of SAS programmers feel the crunch.</p>
<p>So, in 2016, I</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Jiangtang/Homer-networkX">learned some Python</a>,</li>
<li>attended <a href="https://pydata.org/carolinas2016/">Pydata Carolinas</a>,</li>
<li>learned some Spark, and got certified by edX somehow with all the bubble words in the title, <a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/85c0f27c305b49abafee8da0005191a1">Distributed Machine Learning with Apache Spark</a>,</li>
<li>learned some math, <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/">Linear Algebra</a>,</li>
<li>learned more math, <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube">Probability</a>,</li>
<li>learned even more math, <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~ctk/ma580.html">Numerical Analysis</a>, and</li>
<li>didn’t update one single blog post, because all my spare time and coffee making time were simply run out.</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel much better after one year of burying my head in the sand. Keep tuned, 2017.</p>
