## Surgeons must be very careful (156)

> When they take the knife!   
> Underneath their fine incisions   
> Stirs the Culpritâ€”Life!

## I'm Nobody! Who Are You?

> I'm nobody! Who are you?   
> Are you nobody, too?   
> Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!  
> They'd banish us, you know.   
>   
> How dreary to be somebody!  
> How public, like a frog   
> To tell your name the livelong day  
> To an admiring bog!
