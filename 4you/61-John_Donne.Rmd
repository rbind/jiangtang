# John Donne



## No Man is an Island

> No man is an island, entire of itself;   
> every man is a piece of the continent,   
>     a part of the main;   
>    
> if a clod be washed away by the sea,   
> Europe is the less,   
>  as well as if a promontory were,   
> as well as any manner of thy friends   
> or of thine  own were;   
>    
> Any man's death diminishes me,   
> because I am involved in mankind.   
> And therefore never send to know   
> for whom the bell tolls;   
> it tolls for thee.
