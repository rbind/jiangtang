## The Impossible Dream

> To dream the impossible dream  
> To fight the unbeatable foe  
> To bear with unbearable sorrow  
> To run where the brave dare not go  
> To right the unrightable wrong  
> To love pure and chaste from afar  
> To try when your arms are too weary  
> To reach the unreachable star  
>   
> This is my quest  
> To follow that star  
> No matter how hopeless  
> No matter how far  
>   
> To fight for the right  
> Without question or pause  
> To be willing to march into Hell  
> For a heavenly cause  
>   
> And I know if I'll only be true     
> To this glorious quest  
> That my heart will lie peaceful and calm  
> When I'm laid to my rest  
>   
> And the world will be better for this  
> That one man, scorned and covered with scars  
> Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
> To reach the unreachable star

## 要做那不可能实现的梦

> 要做那不可能实现的梦,   
> 对抗无法匹敌的对手,   
> 承受难以承受的悲痛。     
> 去往勇者以畏惧之地,      
> 纠正那无法改正的错误。    
> 成为远远超越自己的人。   
> 即使双臂疲惫不堪，   
> 仍要尽力去尝试,   
> 要摘下那遥不可及的星星。
