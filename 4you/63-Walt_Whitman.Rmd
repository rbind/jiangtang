# Walt Whitman



## Song of Myself (52)

> You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,  
> But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,  
> And filter and fibre your blood.  
>   
> Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,  
> Missing me one place search another,  
> I stop somewhere waiting for you.
